Welcome to the Sad World README.

This game is no longer in development under the XNA framework. I had an amazing time creating this game and loved learning as I moved further and further into development. 
Coding this game allowed me to learn much faster and immediately apply new coding techniques as I learned them. 

For future reference, one person shouldn't code a game engine. Enjoy looking at my code :)
