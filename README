Welcome to the Sad World README.

Sad World is my attempt at a 2D side scroller game. I used the development of this game to learn how to program. Dev log available here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlzxSr8dQGXAemYoObwxSlGLwDX3aunfK

This game is no longer in development under the XNA framework. I had an amazing time creating this game and loved learning as I moved further and further into development. 
Coding this game allowed me to learn much faster and immediately apply new coding techniques as I learned them. 

For future reference, one person shouldn't code a game engine. Enjoy looking at my code :)
